This project was coded from the ground up in React to pull and display live crypto data using CoinGecko's API.

While crypto data often seems complex, this project's primary focus was to instead display the data in a clean, approachable, and easy to use way.

## React Libraries Used

Most of the elements were created manually in HTML/CSS.
In addition, I used Chakra UI for a few elements such as the mobile drop-down menu.

Navigation is taken care of using React Router Dom.

Everything is mobile-responsive and ready to roll on all devices.
